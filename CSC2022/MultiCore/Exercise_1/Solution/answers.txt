We said that the 75% of the time is spent waiting I/O operations: 
the remaining 25% scales well with the available cores.
Therefore, the P parameter in Amdahl's law will be .25.
Now, taking into account the different values of the P and N parameter
suggested in the exercise, the speedups with respect to the 
serial version are:

P=25% N=4 -> S=1.23
P=25% N=8 -> S=1.28
P=25% N=200 -> S=1.33
P=30% N=4 -> S=1.29

This is simple python function to check the numbers above:

def a(n,p):
    return 1./((1-p)+float(p)/n)
